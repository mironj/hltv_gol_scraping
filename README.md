Scrapning functions that first obtain relevant information needed to create a series of URLs, which then are used to gather historical information on CS teams (from HLTV) and LoL team (Games of Legends).

This particular code uses Scraping Bee API, which has worked for me.

THE CODE IS A WIP, IT DOES NOT WORK YET. I WILL UPLOAD WORKING VERSION SOON.
